\chapter{Introduction}

Plan Recognition is a problem which consists of looking at a sequence of actions by an agent, and deduce possible goals that these actions achieve. Plan Recognition has many potential applications, including network intrusion detection, human-robot interaction and assisted care scenarios.

In many of these potential problem domains, including the ones mentioned above, it is desirable to perform plan recognition in real time, rather than offline as a batch computation. However currently for performance reasons it is often infeasible to perform Plan Recognition in real time.

In this project, we investigate several methods for parallelising a particular Plan Recognition algorithm in C++. We investigate the performance on two different problem domains, and how the performance scales up with the number of available hardware threads.
