\section{Plan Recognition}

TODO discuss plan recognition and its potential applications
TODO discuss plan recog is symbolic, how it fits into larger system (e.g. get symbols from behaviour recog, get grammars authored or learned (future work))

\section{Combinatorial Categorical Grammars}

TODO describe Categorical Grammars, Combinatorial Categorical Grammars

\section{Applying CCGs to Plan Recognition}

TODO

\section{The ELEXIR Algorithm}

TODO describe the ELEXIR algorithm

\section{Concurrency Techniques}

TODO describe locking and lock-free techniques
TODO describe mutexes, condition variables
TODO describe memory barriers, atomic operations, hazard pointers (or later?)
TODO describe performance issues: waiting, kernel switches, busy waits, starvation, priority inversion, cache contention and false sharing
TODO describe correctness issues: missed wake-ups, deadlocks, static/dynamic hazards, ABA problem, ...

\section{Multicore Job Scheduling Techniques}

TODO describe single queue
TODO describe multiple queues with main thread redistributing work
TODO describe work-stealing
TODO reference that XB360/dev conf talk on job queues?
TODO mention dependencies between tasks, tasks producing other tasks

\section{Applying Job Scheduling Techniques to ELEXIR}

TODO describe how ELEXIR is well-suited to job scheduling - tasks generate the new tasks that depend on them, pure fan-out with no dependencies sideways and no shared resources needing to be updated
TODO describe how we choose to split work
TODO Work out the complexity (Could go in appendix)

TODO Work out the perfect $T_1$ to $T_\infty$ speedup (Could go in appendix)
