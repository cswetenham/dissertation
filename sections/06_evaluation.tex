\chapter{Evaluation}

TODO here compare the different approaches, have graphs with results from all algorithms

TODO describe choice of metrics (or do this earlier?)

TODO describe the domains used (or do this earlier?)

TODO discuss hyperthreading and how it affects scaling of performance with number of threads (mention this in background too?)

TODO compare the speedup we get to a perfect $T_1$ to $T_\infty$ speedup
