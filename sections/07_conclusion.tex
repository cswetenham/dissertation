\chapter{Conclusion}

TODO draw conclusions from the results - why is work stealing so much better for this problem?

TODO future work: exploring only the most likely explanations given the observations so far

TODO future work: improving the memory allocation behaviour of the algorithm and testing different memory allocators better suited to multi-threaded code

TODO future work: paralellising the probability computation (would be automatic, and probably have better memory locality, if we did it incrementally)

TODO future work: incremental version, producing explanations each observations

TODO future work: discarding observations of a certain age if unused?
