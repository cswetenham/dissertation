Plan Recognition is an area of Artificial Intelligence research with many potential applications in which it is desirable to perform it in real time. In order to devise a performant solution for plan recognition, we study the ELEXIR algorithm for plan recognition in C++. We find it well suited to parallelisation using multithreaded job scheduling techniques and apply several scheduling techniques, including lock-free work stealing. We and analyse and report on the speed and scalability of these techniques when applied to plan recognition.
